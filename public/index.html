<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p><strong>tldr</strong>: This is the last update I will be making to <a href="https://chrisman.github.io" class="uri">https://chrisman.github.io</a>. Please update your bookmarks and rss readers to <a href="https://chrismanbrown.gitlab.io" class="uri">https://chrismanbrown.gitlab.io</a>.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-wrong-with-github">What is wrong with Github</h2>
<p>Here‚Äôs a roughly chronological list of all the issues I‚Äôve had with Github.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Github has a weird monopoly on web frontends for git, and on open source software hosting. I think the majority of people think that in some ways Github <em>is</em> git, which is like thinking Gmail is email. I‚Äôve had to use Gitlab and Bitbucket because of work, but for the most part, Github is the <em>de facto</em> git hosting option.</p></li>
<li><p>Github continues to sell its services to ICE over the protest of its employees and many of its users.</p></li>
<li><p>Github banned Iranian users‚Äìsome of them paying customers‚Äìbased on nationality[^1].</p></li>
</ol>
<p>[^1] It has been claimed that Github was legally obliged to ban Iranian users to be in compliance with embargos against Iran at the time.</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li><p>I‚Äôm very uncomfortable with Microsoft, one of the most monopolistic and anti-competition software companies in history, owning most of the free software in the world through acquiring Github and NPM. Which brings us to‚Ä¶</p></li>
<li><p>Github Copilot. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm likely to be personally effected by Copilot. I have no delusions that <em>my</em> code would be useful to the AI. Nonetheless, I care about this very much in the same way that I care about the Bill of Rights. Github fed copyrighted code to their AI, and there is now no way to acknowledge and/or compensate the creators of that code. Acknowledegment and/or compensation that is required by most open source copyrights. Github violated the rights of its users.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="what-to-do-now">What to do now</h2>
<p>I‚Äôm going to be going through my github repos and deleting most of them. (Most of my repos are old code school assignments anyway.) I probably only have half a dozen or so repos that are important or useful enough for me to keep.</p>
<p>Most of my sites/blogs are already checked into a private git server anyway.</p>
<p>In a perfect world, I should just self-host everything.</p>
<p>In an imperfect world full of humans, I‚Äôll be moving over to Gitlab in the short turn because they provide static site hosting in a way very similar to github pages.</p>
<p>I can‚Äôt do anything as dramatic or final as deleting my account, because I still need it for work. And there‚Äôs also the consideration of ‚ÄúGithub profile as resume‚Äù to consider. I don‚Äôt know how much or how often employers really look at github activity when considering hiring a developer.</p>
