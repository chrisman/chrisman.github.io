## About

I'm a software developer in Denver, Colorado. I blog about stuff here. The stuff I blog about is mostly technology related. The tech stuff I like includes web dev and JavaScript; functional programming; vim and zsh and tmux, and other UNIX-y things.

## Blog

This is all the stuff I write and then decide to post on the web.
