Here are all the books I read in 2019!

I don't want to write any individual reviews here. Those are all on
[goodreads][1]. I want to use this space instead to look at some patterns and
trends.

Also, here's the nifty little [Year In Review page][2] that goodreads made for me. Thanks, goodreads!

## Top Recommendations

These are the best books of the year.

### Fantasy

- The Broken Earth Series

    Jemisin is my new favorite author. I cannot wait to read more of her.

- Gideon the Ninth

    Wacky, weird, and original

### Nonfiction

- Why We Sleep: Unlocking the Power of Sleep and Dreams

    literally life changing

- Dreamland: The True Tale of America's Opiate Epidemic

    comprehensive overview of the US opioid epidemic.

### Graphic Novel

- My Degeneration: A Journey Through Parkinson's

    quick read, very revealing

### Comics

- Paper Girls

    If Stranger Things was about girls with paper routes, and had more time travel

### Fiction

- Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell

    Hauntingly beautiful

- Beartown

    It was just really pretty. really, really well done.

## Goals

Reading goals for 2019 and 2020.

### 2019 Goals

For the second year in a row, I set a goal to read 100 books, and then fell
short of achieving that goal.

I might have hit 100 this year if I hadn't taken a long hiatus this summer from
reading any audiobooks. (I spent that time listening to a lot of podcasts
instead of reading.)

### 2020 Goals

I'm going to set the same goal again next year, and hope that the third time is
the charm! I think I can hit it because I project the following:

- I can usually read roughly one audiobook a week. If I do *half* of that, it's
  still 26. So I'll start off with estimating 25 as a lower limit and, let's
  say 50 as an upper limit. (25 / 50)

- I can also usually read one comic book/graphic novel each weekend. I'll give
  that the same 25/50 upper/lower bounds. (total: 50 / 100)

- One book every month for bookclub at work is another 12. (total: 62 / 112)

- I finish 1 - 3 books each year while vacationing (total: 63 / 115)

- And I read at least one other book every month or two, so that's another
  6 - 12. (total: 69 / 127)

The dead middle of that range is 98. Round up to 100 and call it a day! 2020 is
gonna be my year, I can tell. I can feel it. The year of 100 books!


## Numbers

Here's some numbers.

- 82 Total Books
    - 19 Audiobooks
    - 27 Tangible Book: Mostly comics and D&D source books. I was surprised by
      this high number. I definitely consider myself an "eBooks only" kind of
      reader.
    - 36 eBooks 

- 23,381 Pages

- 3 "Did Not Finish": some books are boring, or terrible, and life's too short
  to spend on bad books.

- Ratings: (Average rating = 3.6) I think I had started the year with this idea
  of only giving out 1 star or 5 stars. Create a "thumbs up / thumbs down"
  system. I didn't stick to that. But I still think that the 5 star scale
  continues to be problematic. I just never know what a two or a four is
  supposed to be.
    - five star: 24
    - four star: 17
    - three star: 22
    - two star: 7
    - one star: 4

### Fantasy

Broken Earth is one of the best things I have ever read. Finishing the series
is one of my highlights of the year. I want to recommend it to people who don't
even read fantasy.

Ratcatchers was another standout, and Gideon was so fresh and weird and unique and great.

tropey and, for the most part, just plain good fun.
