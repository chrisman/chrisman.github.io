Hi ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software developer and yoga teacher in Denver, Colorado specializing in building humanistic full stack web applications, and yoga.

This is my personal blog. I mostly write about techy stuff, but you should also expect some more personal stuff now and then.

I like JavaScript and I like functional programming.

I live in the terminal: ssh, tmux, and vim are my home.

I believe in life-long learning, am an [avid reader](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/409485-christopher), and try to [learn in public](https://github.com/chrisman/knowledge/wiki).

I'm vegan, have two dogs, like running and biking and baking.

I live with a very nice lady who seemingly has yet to tire of my shenanigans, gods bless her.

My pronouns are he/they.
