## What is a graph

There's two things that make a graph:

1. Nodes: points, vertices

2. Edges: links. Lines that connect nodes. Sometimes they're directional, with arrowheads, denoting some kind of a relationship between nodes. Sometimes there are no arrowheads, and the lines are just lines, and there is no kind of order or heirarchy between the nodes.

It's a pretty simple mathematical structure. It describes connections and relations.

There's a whole area of discrete mathematics called *Graph Theory* dedicated to the study of graphs.

## Types of graphs

Lots of things are graphs:

- Trees, binary or otherwise. Tries.

- Graphs describe paths and routing and mapping.

## Appendix A: History of Graph Theory

Here are some stories from the 1700s and 1800s about the history and the origins of modern graph theory.

### Euler and the Seven Bridges

### JJ Sly Invents the Term "Graph"

## Resources

- on February 7, 1878, in *Nature* J. J. Sylvester apparently invents the term
  "graph" to describe an abstraction common to algebraic notation and chemical
  notation.
