Books I Read in 2019
</h1>
<p>
the results of having had my nose in a book for most of the year
</p>
<p>
2019-12-23
</p>
<p>Here are all the books I read in 2019!</p>
<p>I don‚Äôt want to write any individual reviews here. Those are all on <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/409485-christopher?read_at=2019">goodreads</a>. I want to use this space instead to look at some patterns and trends.</p>
<p>Also, here‚Äôs the nifty little <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/year_in_books/2019/409485">Year In Review page</a> that goodreads made for me. Thanks, goodreads!</p>
<h2 id="numbers">Numbers</h2>
<p>Here‚Äôs some numbers.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>83 Total Books</p>
<ul>
<li>19 Audiobooks</li>
<li>27 Tangible Book: Mostly comics and D&amp;D source books. I was surprised by this high number. I definitely consider myself an ‚ÄúeBooks only‚Äù kind of reader.</li>
<li>37 eBooks</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>23,381 Pages</p></li>
<li><p>3 ‚ÄúDid Not Finish‚Äù: some books are boring, or terrible, and life‚Äôs too short to spend on bad books.</p></li>
<li><p>Ratings: (Average rating = 3.6) I think I had started the year with this idea of only giving out 1 star or 5 stars. Create a ‚Äúthumbs up / thumbs down‚Äù system. I didn‚Äôt stick to that. But I still think that the 5 star scale continues to be problematic. I just never know what a two or a four is supposed to be.</p>
<ul>
<li>five star (great): 24</li>
<li>four star (more than good): 17</li>
<li>three star (good): 22</li>
<li>two star (less than good): 7</li>
<li>one star (bad): 4</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>
<p>Reading goals for 2019 and 2020.</p>
<h3 id="goals-1">2019 Goals</h3>
<p>For the second year in a row, I set a goal to read 100 books, and then fell short of achieving that goal.</p>
<p>I might have hit 100 this year if I hadn‚Äôt taken a long hiatus this summer from reading any audiobooks. (I spent that time listening to a lot of podcasts instead of reading.)</p>
<h3 id="goals-2">2020 Goals</h3>
<p>I‚Äôm going to set the same goal again next year, and hope that the third time is the charm! I think I can hit it because I project the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I can usually read roughly one audiobook a week. If I do <em>half</em> of that, it‚Äôs still 26. So I‚Äôll start off with estimating 25 as a lower limit and, let‚Äôs say 50 as an upper limit. (25 / 50)</p></li>
<li><p>I can also usually read one comic book/graphic novel each weekend. I‚Äôll give that the same 25/50 upper/lower bounds. (total: 50 / 100)</p></li>
<li><p>One book every month for bookclub at work is another 12. (total: 62 / 112)</p></li>
<li><p>I finish 1 - 3 books each year while vacationing (total: 63 / 115)</p></li>
<li><p>And I read at least one other book every month or two, so that‚Äôs another 6 - 12. (total: 69 / 127)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The dead middle of that range is 98. Round up to 100 and call it a day! 2020 is gonna be my year, I can tell. I can feel it. The year of 100 books!</p>
