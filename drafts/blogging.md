# How To Start A Blog

I decided to write a blog

## History

I've started, and then ended, plenty of blogs over the years, starting in the
90s with writing longform HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in Notepad.exe and
uploading it via FTP to remote servers. From there I moved on to hosted
platforms like LiveJournal, Blogger/Blogspot (my longest running blog, all
about biking in Denver), Tumblr (briefly), and Wordpress (most briefly).
