Destructuring arrays and objects in JavaScript is something I enjoy doing and
something I enjoy teaching other people about.

## Destrucutring Arrays

Trick: swapping variables

```javascript
let a = 'apple'
let b = 'banana'

[ a, b ] = b, a

console.log(a) // -> banana
console.log(b) // -> apple
```

Neat!
