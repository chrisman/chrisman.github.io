<h2 id="situation">Situation</h2>
<p>Over the years I have had several laptops, phones, and other devices all networked together. Or at least a bunch of devices I’m logged into using the same google account. Either way, I have things that I need to name, and historically I have been bad at it.</p>
<p>I lose track of which thing is which as I rotate devices in and out, and as new devices become old devices and are used for different purposes.</p>
<p>For example, I have “workbook” and “pinebook” and “macbook”. I have “newphone” and “oldphone” but also “oldnewphone”. I retired “workbook2k19” recently, but he was part of the lineup too for a while.</p>
<h2 id="opportunity">Opportunity</h2>
<p>The obvious solution is to adopt and use a naming convention!</p>
<p>Should be easy right?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are 2 hard problems in computer science: cache invalidation, naming things, and off-by-1 errors.</p>

<p>I started thinking seriously about it this weekend after I stumbled across a link to <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1178">RFC 1178: Choosing a Name for Your Computer</a>.</p>
<p>It includes 11 “Don’t”s and 1 “Do”:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Don’t overload other terms already in common use.</li>
<li>Don’t choose a name after a project unique to that machine.</li>
<li>Don’t use your own name.</li>
<li>Don’t use long names.</li>
<li>Avoid alternate spellings.</li>
<li>Avoid domain names.</li>
<li>Avoid domain-like names.</li>
<li>Don’t use antagonistic or otherwise embarrassing names.</li>
<li>Don’t use digits at the beginning of the name.</li>
<li>Don’t use non-alphanumeric characters in a name.</li>
<li>Don’t expect case to be preserved.</li>
<li>Use words/names that are rarely used.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="liberated-versioning">Liberated Versioning</h2>
<p>After reading the RFC and a couple <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090918202746/http://tothink.com/mnemonic/wordlist.html">other</a> <a href="https://mnx.io/blog/a-proper-server-naming-scheme/">guides</a> on naming servers, I was overwhelmed for a little bit by my options and also by the burden of making a “good choice”.</p>
<p>But then I remembered I’m just doing this for myself and I should have fun with it.</p>
<p>I was further inspired by rembering that a friend of a friend who operates <a href="https://coolguy.website/">coolguy.website</a> abandoned and eschewed all the conventional wisdom of semantic versioning in favor of Tarot based versioning, and declared the current v.III of their website to be “<a href="https://coolguy.website/versionIII/">The Empress</a>”.</p>
<p>Sometimes it doesn’t matter that you follow the established rules and conventions. Sometimes you just choose what’s special and meaningful to you.</p>
<h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>
<p>My personal requirements are lax because I’m just naming my own personal devices, not servers or services that will be seen by or used by others.</p>
<p>So one Nice To Have would be for the name list to be reasonably long so I don’t run out of names to choose from. But more importantly, and basically my only really real requirement, is that the names must be fun and memorable.</p>
<h2 id="possibilities">Possibilities</h2>
<p>I asked some of my internet friends what their naming conventions for their devices are, and got some neat responses:</p>
<ul>
<li>pokemon</li>
<li>for rockchip devices, names of rocks. e.g. scoria, flourite</li>
<li>“small critters” for raspberry PIs. e.g. saturnia (giant moth) scolopendra (giant centipede), menemerus (jumping spider), and scutigera (house centipede)</li>
<li>stars and constellations</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="decision">Decision</h2>
<p>Many years ago when I was teaching Outdoor Education to 6th graders in the hills of San Diego, I met this one kid who I still think about all the time.</p>
<p>Everyday, he wore a large black t-shirt with huge white block lettering on it. He had a black trucker hat in the same style, and also a black wristband, because this was that time in the 00s when kids wore wristbands because that was the pop-punk aesthetic.</p>
<p>One day his shirt just said “TACOS”.</p>
<p>The next day “BURRITOS”.</p>
<p>Then “FAJITAS”.</p>
<p>And on and on like that.</p>
<p>Turns out, this cool as hell twelve year old had gotten all these t-shirts and other apparel made and had started his own fashion line called Mexican Food.</p>
<p>I wonder whatever happened to that kid.</p>
<p>Anyway, Kid, where ever you are. This shoutout goes out to you. I’m renaming all of my personal devices after Mexican foods.</p>
<h2 id="the-list">The List</h2>
<p>Here’s what I came up with to start. Should last me a while. And when I’ve used them all up, I’ll move on to something else!</p>
<ul>
<li>burrito</li>
<li>taco</li>
<li>taquito</li>
<li>salsa</li>
<li>guac</li>
<li>chalupa</li>
<li>fajita</li>
<li>nacho</li>
<li>tamale</li>
<li>empanada</li>
<li>chile</li>
<li>arroz</li>
<li>frijole</li>
<li>pico</li>
<li>churro</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>I actually did have a naming convention once in the late 90s / early 00s for a series of clunky linux laptops I had. I forgot all about it until I was almost done writing this article.</p>
<p>For some reason, I settled on names of horses from fiction: Rocinante, Shadowfax, Artax, Doxology.</p>
<p>I don’t remember why. It’s not as though I especially like horses. But I do like the metaphor of the relationship between horse and rider. How they must work together, and how you must care for your horse. There’s a special bond between a Lone Ranger and his Silver out on the open plains.</p>
<p>Doxology was my favorite and longest running of them all. A Toshiba that was already old at the time I recieved it. I installed Mandrake Linux on it and it was my window to the world. After its hard drive failed, I kept it running with a business card CD with <a href="http://www.damnsmalllinux.org/">Damn Small Linux</a> on it, and a thumb drive to store my files.</p>
<p>I finally freecycled it to a couple on the beach before moving away from California.</p>
<p>But yeah. Let’s go with Taco next. After all, there’s not an emoji for Doxology.</p>
<p>🌮🌮</p>
