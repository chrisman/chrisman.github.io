## How to blog

1. Drafts: collect ideas and working drafts in `/drafts`.
2. Sources: once a draft is complete, move it to `/src/posts`. Then perform the following edits:
    1. Edit `/src/index.md` to include a link to the post
    2. Increment the li counter in `/styles/index.css`
3. Build: `make`
